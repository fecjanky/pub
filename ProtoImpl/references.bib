The UMTS Forum Report 44 ``Mobile traffic forecasts 2010--2020 report'' is built on a traffic model which distinguishes service categories (video/audio streaming, web browsing, mobile gaming, etc.), device categories (low-end phones, smartphones, tablets, wireless adapters for laptops and desktop computers, connected embedded devices, etc.) and various subscriber activity patterns. These components contribute to the overall traffic models though parameters such as traffic per service, traffic per device, device mix, upload/download direction, period of the day/week/month/year and others.

% Examples __________________________________________________________

The three most common and typical types of references used in
IEEE publications:

an article in a journal
Note the use of the IEEE_J_EDL string, defined in the IEEEabrv.bib file,
for the journal name. IEEEtran.bst defines the BibTeX standard three
letter month codes per IEEE style.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices",
page 996, reference #16.
@article{IEEEexample:article_typical,
  author        = "S. Zhang and C. Zhu and J. K. O. Sin and P. K. T. Mok",
  title         = "A Novel Ultrathin Elevated Channel Low-temperature 
                   Poly-{Si} {TFT}",
  journal       = IEEE_J_EDL,
  volume        = "20",
  month         = nov,
  year          = "1999",
  pages         = "569-571"
}


journal article using et al.
The (five) authors are actually: F. Delorme, S. Slempkes, G. Alibert, 
B. Rose, J. Brandon
The month (July) was not given here.
From the September 1998 issue of "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in
Communications", page 1257, reference #28.
@article{IEEEexample:articleetal,
  author        = "F. Delorme and others",
  title         = "Butt-jointed {DBR} Laser With 15 {nm} Tunability Grown
                   in Three {MOVPE} Steps",

a paper in a conference proceedings
"conference" can be used as an alias for "inproceedings"
From the June 2002 issue of "Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems",
page 205, reference #16.
TrustNode

a book
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Magnetics",
page 1466, reference #4.
@book{IEEEexample:book_typical,
  author        = "B. D. Cullity",

Other examples

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits
or longer into groups of three with small spaces between them. Page ranges
can be separated via either "-" or "--", IEEEtran.bst will automatically
convert the separator dash(es) to "--".
Authors and/or IEEE do not always provide/use the journal number, but it
was used in this case. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore journal
numbers if desired.
From the August 2000 issue of "IEEE Photonics Technology Letters",
page 1039, reference #11.
@article{IEEEexample:articlelargepages,

}


conference paper with volume number. A conference proceedings with a vol
number is a little uncommon, note that the vol number is placed
before the address in the formatted bibliography entry
From the April 2002 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 181, reference #26.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:confwithvolume,

for those times when "Tech. Rep." needs to be modified

electronic with a howpublished information field 
From the August 2001 issue of "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 391, reference #7.
@electronic{IEEEexample:electronhowinfo,
  author        = "V. Jacobson",

Other unusual references

a private communication as a misc entry type
sometimes the designation "personal communication" is used instead

@misc{IEEEexample:private,
  author        = "S. Konyagin",
  howpublished  = "private communication",
  year          = "1998"
}



CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.
@standard{IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",

  month         = May,
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}
